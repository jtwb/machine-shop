**Subject:** http://github.com/

0. Create an account on GitHub
1. Once you're signed in, every page on GitHub has a "New..." button in the upper-right corner. As of 2014, that button looks like this: ![GitHub Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/machine-shop/Screen+Shot+2014-07-11+at+2.39.44+PM.png)

2. That takes you to the New Repo form ![GitHub Screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/machine-shop/Screen+Shot+2014-07-11+at+3.03.40+PM.png)

3. If it worked, you should see something like this:
