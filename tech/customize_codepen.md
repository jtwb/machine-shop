#### Tech: Make Codepen.io pretty

**Subject:** http://codepen.io/

At its worst, CodePen can look like this:

## Smaller fonts
To adjust the font size just use your browser's "zoom" feature. On OSX you can use `⌘ -`, `⌘ +` and `⌘ 0` to control this. I find that setting the zoom level to ~50% looks pretty good.

## No flickering background
To kill the flickering background, drag this link to your browser's bookmarks bar. Clicking the bookmark (while you are looking at codepen.io) will kill the flicker problem.
