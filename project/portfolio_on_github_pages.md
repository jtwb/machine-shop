##### Project: Create your own portfolio site on Github Pages

When this project is complete, you will have built a basic portfolio page using HTML and CSS. It will be available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`. It will use Twitter Bootstrap with a custom skin.


## The plan

0. Start with a really basic HTML portfolio page: http://codepen.io/jtwb/pen/ukCyA
0. Customize the content a little
0. Add Twitter Bootstrap to the page
0. Add a Twitter Bootstrap Skin to the page
0. Publish the page on GitHub
0. Customize the page to your liking

## Starting point

(image: basic portfolio page)

## First, open the code in Codepen

(image: codepen code)

Hit the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the project.

You may want to [customize codepen](tech/customize_codepen.md).

## Customize the content a little bit

Try changing the text on the page. Don't worry - you can undo (`âŒ˜ v`) and even re-fork the original project to get back to the start.

Inlcude your name in `<h1>` tag, edit the subtitle, change the `<h2>` sections and link to some cool content you've created. Save your work.

## Add Twitter Bootstrap

This section requires you to [add a CSS file to your page](tech/add_css_with_a_link_tag.md).

Use a `<link>` tag to include `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.css` on the page. [More info on no-protocol URLs](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/).
